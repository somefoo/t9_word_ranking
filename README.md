# t9_word_ranking

A quick & dirty collection of scripts that were used to rank words for T9 keyboard input. When entering a T9 key-combination, the word that is most frequent should be suggested by the auto-completer. This script tries to sort all words with a common T9 key combination based on word frequencies.

The ranking information is based on word frequencies as obtained from books. For example from the Gutenberg [project](https://www.gutenberg.org/).
